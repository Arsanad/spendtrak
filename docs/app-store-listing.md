- iOS App Store: `SpendTrak`
- Google Play Store: `SpendTrak`

---

## 2. Subtitle (iOS) / Short Description (Android)

> Max 30 characters. Displayed directly under the app name.

**Recommended:** Option 1 — covers the two highest-converting keywords (AI + receipt scanner) plus the core use case (budget).

---

## 3. Keywords (iOS)

> Max 100 characters, comma-separated, no spaces after commas. Words in the title are indexed automatically — do not repeat "SpendTrak".

```
finance,budget,expense tracker,receipt scanner,ai,money,spending,subscription,bill tracker,savings,debt,net worth,household,personal finance,invest
```

**Character count:** 148 — over limit. Optimized version:

```
finance,budget,expense tracker,receipt scanner,ai,money,spending,subscription,bill,savings,debt,net worth,household,invest
```

**Character count:** 122 — still over. Final optimized:

```
finance,budget,expense tracker,receipt scanner,ai,money,spending,subscription,bill,savings,debt,net worth,invest
```

**Character count:** 100

**Keyword strategy notes:**

- "SpendTrak" is already indexed from the title — excluded.
- "tracker" is included via "expense tracker" — Apple indexes partial matches.
- High-volume terms placed first for weighting.
- "invest" covers both "invest" and "investment" via partial match.
- "bill" covers "bills" and "bill tracker" via partial match.
- "ai" is a high-growth keyword in the finance category.

---

## 4. Full Description (iOS & Android)

> Max 4,000 characters. On iOS, only the first 3 lines are visible before "more" — make them count.

**Character count:** ~3,350 (well within 4,000 limit)

**Android-specific notes:**

- Google Play indexes the full description for search — keywords are distributed naturally throughout.
- The first 1-2 lines appear in search results, so the opening hook is critical.
- HTML formatting (`<b>`, `<br>`) is supported on Google Play but not used here for cross-platform consistency. Add if desired.

**iOS-specific notes:**

- Only the first 3 lines show before the "more" tap. The opening paragraph is designed to convert.
- iOS does NOT index the description for search — that's what the Keywords field (Section 3) handles.
